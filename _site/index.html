<p>Have you ever been in a classroom and one child takes another child’s pencil and in a split second that child hits the other child and snatch the pencil? Ever see a child in the grocery store laid out on the floor crying because they want that pack of gum? Ever seen the angry young boy who storms out the room, breaking pencils, yelling he does not care? If you answered yes to any of the questions above, you are either a witness or an involved party of a student reacting with aggression.  As an educator in the public school system,  I observe these behaviors in my classroom daily. Unfortunately, my African American males struggle to control their aggression more than others. These reactions are triggered by behaviors, such as, another student being selected to answer a question, not having the correct answer to a question, not wanting to complete classwork or being redirected to display positive behaviors. The reactions can be anything from a loud outburst of “I don’t care!”,  breaking pencils, throwing materials across the room, cursing and even storming out the classroom. I understand that these youth who are reacting with aggression, on a consistent basis, believe this to be the best way to react to fulfill a specific need. I am here to help parents, teachers, and scholars with tools to cope and control aggressive behavior</p>

<h3 id="effects-of-the-condition-on-school-and-home-behavior">Effects of the Condition on School and Home Behavior</h3>

<p>I believe that students are more influenced by their peers in the primary school years as opposed to their middle and high school years. I think when children see their peers react to being upset with aggression, the other students in that classroom or environment began to think that it is acceptable to show those behaviors. “Developmental theory and research suggest that exposure to aggressive classrooms might have a stronger impact on aggressive child behavior when it occurs early in elementary school” (Thomas &amp; Bierman). Reacting with aggression then becomes the norm. Students who constantly react with this aggressive behavior also seem to do poorly in their academics. Often they do not complete assignments or do not persevere through the challenging task.  These students often do not have many healthy relationships with their peers because they react and display aggression with them as well. Students display theses exact or very similar aggressive behaviors when they are at home. If a child is asked to do something at home that they do not want to do, they will react with aggression. The parents also begin to react aggressively unconsciously because they are constantly having to discipline their children.</p>

<h3 id="theoretical-framework">Theoretical Framework</h3>

<p>The theory that I chose to help me look into this behavior is the Social Learning Theory by Albert Bandura. Bandura’s Social Learning Theory posits that people learn from one another, via observation, imitation, and modeling. The theory has often been called a bridge between behaviorist and cognitive learning theories because it encompasses attention, memory, and motivation (David, 2015). This theory suggests that  a child sees an aggressive behavior done by a peer or superior, then that child remembers that behavior.  They become motivated to do the behavior, and if they feel comfortable enough with themselves, they copy and display that behavior, often on a regular basis.</p>

<p>This theory implies that aggressive behavior can be learned from other people. I would like to translate this theory into practice observing one particular student for two weeks. In week one, when the student is off task or needs to be re-engaged, I will purposely react with aggression as well. I will make sure that it is clear I am very angry with him if he breaks any classroom rules. I will also be more aggressive with enforcing the rules with everyone that week. Showing my students that I get frustrated easily and react by yelling and fussing. In week two, I will take a different approach. I will not get upset with my student, and if he breaks a rule, I will talk to him calmly, and let him know that it is ok, and he should try better next time. I will not raise my voice at my class, anytime during that week. I will try to be calm the entire time, while still enforcing all classroom rules. I will also provide many opportunities for students to receive rewards this week, including group points, trojan dollars and free time minutes. I will show no signs of aggression, anger or frustration this entire second week. I will ask my student’s parents to be a part of the two-week observation. I would ask them to display more aggressive behaviors week one, and the reverse behaviors the following weeks. I would then observe and record how those students are reacting in class, with their peers, and with their family. I will  ask the parents to watch and record the different behaviors each week at home, in extracurriculars, etc. After the two weeks, I would look to see the difference in the aggressive behaviors from week to week. I would be looking to see if there was more of less aggression one week to the other, and also what could have been the factors.</p>

<h3 id="developmentally-appropriate-strategies-to-meet-the-challenge-at-home">Developmentally Appropriate Strategies to Meet the Challenge at Home</h3>

<p>One strategy I would suggest to teachers is promoting and implementing the importance of students having a “growth mindset” to build their confidence. A growth mindset is about the effort and the growth of a student. Yeager &amp; Walton states, “When students first come to understand that learning can rewire the brain and increase their intelligence, they often become more interested in learning and less afraid to do things that might make them “look dumb.” In other words, they develop a growth mindset.” Also stating, “Educators can help students develop a growth mindset by teaching them about the amazing properties of the brain. For students to have a growth mindset, they should understand that trying harder —and trying new strategies—not only helps them succeed at the current task but also helps them succeed in the future by strengthening their brain (Yeager &amp; Walton, 2011). 
Another strategy is making a positive phone call to students home every day. Choose five parents a day and share with them something positive that went on with their child that day. The strategy may not seem necessary, but it makes the child feel good when their parents get a good report from school. The child may even want to continue to imitate that positive behavior, in hopes of another call. 
Lastly, I would suggest that the teacher gives the most aggressive students in your class daily behavior reports. These reports can be either a number or a color system. At the end of each day, the child gets a report and a 1-minute check in about his or her behavior. The report should be signed by the parent every day. Once a child gets an entire week with positive behavior, he or she receives a small reward.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-track-of-progress">Keeping Track of Progress</h3>

<p>Keeping track of the event is more about observation, and looking for signs to show that the aggressive behavior is changing. You can progress and track if students are becoming successful, simply by observing his or her  aggressive behaviors at home. If the child is continuing to react with aggression and there are no changes in his behavior, then the strategies both the teacher and the parent are implementing may not be working. I will look into other strategies and continue to look into the “why” of this behavior.  I will also look into other biological factors that could be causing this particular behavior as well.</p>
